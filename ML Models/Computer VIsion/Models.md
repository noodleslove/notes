## AlexNet
- **Overview**: Developed by Alex Krizhevsky, AlexNet is one of the earliest deep learning models that popularized the use of CNNs in image classification.
- **Key Features**:
    - Simple architecture with 8 layers.
    - ReLU activation functions and dropout regularization.
- **Applications**: General image classification and historical benchmarks.

## ResNet (Residual Networks)
- **Overview**: ResNet, introduced by Microsoft Research, revolutionized [deep learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-deep-learning/) by using residual connections to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.
- **Variants**: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ResNet-152.
- **Key Features**:
    - Deep architectures (up to 152 layers).
    - Residual blocks to allow gradients to flow through shortcut connections.
- **Applications**: General image classification, object detection, and feature extraction.

## MobileNet
- **Overview**: Developed by Google, MobileNet models are designed for mobile and embedded vision applications.
- **Variants**: MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3.
- **Key Features**:
    - Lightweight architecture optimized for mobile devices.
    - Depth-wise separable convolutions.
- **Applications**: Mobile image classification and embedded vision applications.
