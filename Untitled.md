Hi! We just created a project group on canvas, and I accidentally missed one groupmate. I tried to add him into the group, but it doesn't allow me to do so. Our group is "Project Group 12", and the person I'm trying to add is "Yuxuan Wu (yuw095@ucsd.edu)". I was wondering if you may help us to add him into our group. Thank you so much!
